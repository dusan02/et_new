ðŸš‘ Hotfix: Cleanup job no longer deletes today's data

## Root Cause
Cleanup job (`clearOldData.ts`) was deleting today's earnings data 
(`gte: today`) without immediate re-fetch, causing empty DB and 
"No Earnings Scheduled" on frontend.

## Changes

### Core Fix
- `src/queue/jobs/clearOldData.ts`:
  - Changed deletion filter from `gte: today` to `lt: today`
  - Now deletes ONLY older data, preserves today's records
  - Updated logs to confirm data preservation

### New Deployment Tools
- `immediate-data-restore.sh` - Emergency data restoration
- `manual-fetch-fallback.sh` - Manual fetch trigger
- `post-hotfix-check.sh` - Post-deployment validation
- `pm2-start.sh` - PM2 wrapper with proper ENV loading
- `cleanup-crlf.sh` - Windows line ending cleanup
- `ecosystem.production.config.js` - PM2 config with ENV

### Documentation
- `HOTFIX-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md` - Quick deployment checklist
- `HOTFIX-SUMMARY.md` - Change summary
- `POLYGON-404-FIX-EXAMPLE.md` - Optional 404 handling

## Impact
âœ… Today's data is never deleted during cleanup
âœ… Cleanup still removes old data (>7 days)
âœ… PM2 processes have proper environment variables
âœ… Deployment is more reliable with helper scripts

## Testing
- Cleanup job preserves today's records
- API returns `{"status":"ok","data":[...]}`
- Website displays earnings table correctly
- PM2 logs show "âœ… Today's data PRESERVED"
